**Question**

The purpose of our project is to answer the following question: *Can we forecast the energy consumption for a building based on key, basic inputs?*

**Dataset**

Our dataset is taken from Schneider Electric (https://shop.exchange.se.com/apps/54008/forecasting-building-energy-consumption), a multi-national energy company. It includes over 10,000,000 records spanning 4 distinct datasets: historical energy consumption, building metadata, historical weather data and public holidays. Given the information listed above, we should be able to build a predictive model on building energy consumption. We will use historical energy consumption as our training metric, with attributes such as weather data, building specifications, and other factors as features in our model. 

**Project Value**

Energy efficiency is a key issue at the forefront of the current environmental crisis. An accurate forecast for energy consumption, especially for large manufacturing facilites, can help identify which buildings may pose issues in the future with regards to wasting energy resources. Furthermore, the insights derived from this model can help companies identify areas where implementing energy saving policies would optimize current operations. We hypothesize that there will be a clear link between key data (weather, building size, public holidays, etc.) and energy consumption. The hope is that this tool can be a valuable asset for the manufacturing industry and energy consumption analysis in general.
